### HW0: Introduction
Welcome to my blog.
<br/> I am a senior at the College of Charleston and am pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

### HW1: Chapter 1
<br/> 1.3: What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four
other attributes that may sometimes be significant.
-Acceptability, Dependability and security, Efficiency, and Maintainability
-Some additional attributes might be: Ease of use, Reliability, Response time, and Backwards compatibility

<br/> 1.8: Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or
lawyers.
-I believe software engineers should be licensed in the same way doctors and lawyers are. Just like doctors and lawyers, software engineers need to be able to produce quality work or else it could result in massive amounts of damage. Take doctors, for example, if they didn't have to be licensed they could dismiss something a patient brings up that could be an issue down the road. Software engineers also need this level of quality because if their work isn't up to par it could result in significant financial damage or loss of life depending on the application.

<br/> 1.9: For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an appropriate example that illustrates that clause.
<br/>Public: Software engineers will work to better their software through feedback/criticism.
<br/>Client and Employer: Software engineers will abide by the 4 professional responsibilities when working for a client or employer. Them being Confidentiality, Competence, <br/>Intellectual property rights, and avoiding computer misuse
<br/>Product: As stated earlier Software engineers need to uphold a level of quality. They should run and show several tests of the software working as anticipated.
<br/>Judgment: Software engineers should use their professional judgment properly, ie not add extra features to raise the price or cause more bloat. They should be confident in the work they produce
<br/>Management: When bringing new software engineers onboard management should go over and make sure the new engineers understand good ethics.
<br/>Profession: Software engineers need to uphold a level of quality and trust with the client/employer for their organization to grow as a whole. 
<br/>Colleagues: Software engineers should accept and supply constructive criticism/feedback when coming from a fellow engineer or a client/employer.
<br/>Self: Software engineers should always be learning and improving themselves throughout their careers.

<br/> 1.10: To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.
<br/> One one hand, having such large scale tracking violates the privacy of citizens and if this system was compromised could result in a catastrophic leak of private information. On the other hand, it does provide citizens with more protection when it comes to terrorism and could lead to the prevention of terrorist attacks on that country's soil.
