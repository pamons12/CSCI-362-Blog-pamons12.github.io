### HW0: Introduction
Welcome to my blog.
<br/> I am a senior at the College of Charleston and am pursuing a BS in Computer Science.

### HW1: Chapter 1
<br/> 1.3: What are the four important attributes that all professional software should possess? Suggest four
other attributes that may sometimes be significant.
<br/>-Acceptability, Dependability and security, Efficiency, and Maintainability
<br/>-Some additional attributes might be: Ease of use, Reliability, Response time, and Backwards compatibility

<br/> 1.8: Discuss whether professional software engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or
lawyers.
<br/>-I believe software engineers should be licensed in the same way doctors and lawyers are. Just like doctors and lawyers, software engineers need to be able to produce quality work or else it could result in massive amounts of damage. Take doctors, for example, if they didn't have to be licensed they could dismiss something a patient brings up that could be an issue down the road. Software engineers also need this level of quality because if their work isn't up to par it could result in significant financial damage or loss of life depending on the application.

<br/> 1.9: For each of the clauses in the ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics shown in Figure 1.4, propose an
appropriate example that illustrates that clause.

<br/> 1.10: To help counter terrorism, many countries are planning or have developed computer systems that
track large numbers of their citizens and their actions. Clearly, this has privacy implications. Discuss
the ethics of working on the development of this type of system.
